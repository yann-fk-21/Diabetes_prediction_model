## Project Overview
The Diabetes Prediction Model aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical attributes. The goal is to provide a tool that can help in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yann-fk-21/Diabetes_prediction_model.git
```
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd Diabetes_prediction_model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Run the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset) and contains various medical records related to diabetes. Each record includes attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, age, etc.

## Model
The model is built using machine learning algorithms which of Logistic Regression. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning have been performed to improve the model's accuracy.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy. The results are presented in the notebook and show the effectiveness of the model in predicting diabetes.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
